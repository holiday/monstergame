- SmartMonsters spawn 10% of the total monsters supplied

- Data from the form was not validated i.e. as a proof of concept, one would 
	simply use some regex, limit the amount of monsters so the user cannot exceed the grid

- Monsters CAN KILL EACHOTHER! This is not a bug, this was coded in. If a monster is surrounded
	and has nowhere to go, it dies.

- The popup window displaying the form uses elements of css3 transitions, it should count towards animation

- I did not include a "quit" buttom simply because I do not know what it should do. I guess if the user clicks
	quit, they could be redirected to the form? Im not sure.
